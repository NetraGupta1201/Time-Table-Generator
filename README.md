## Project Description
The **Time Table Generator** is a Python-based project developed by Netra Gupta and Tarun G. It automates the process of generating timetables for schools, reducing manual effort and time wastage. The project ensures a balanced distribution of subjects and schedules for all classes and teachers throughout the academic year.

For comprehensive details about the project, please consult the document titled "Project Documentation.pdf."

## Value Proposition
The School Timetable Generator distinguishes itself as a pivotal solution for educational institutions. Unlike expensive commercial alternatives, our project offers comparable functionality at an unprecedented level of affordability. By adeptly addressing challenges such as teacher lecture/classroom conflicts, it simplifies scheduling processes, leading to significant improvements in administrative efficiency and overall operational effectiveness. Moreover, its flexibility allows for easy customization to meet specific user needs.

## Objective
The primary objectives of the project include:
- Automating the generation of school timetables to save time and effort.
- Ensuring an equitable distribution of subjects and schedules for classes and teachers.
- Providing a user-friendly interface for easy customization according to school requirements.

## How to Install and Run the Project
To install the School Timetable Generator, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the project using Python 3.7.x or higher.

## How to Use the Project
1. Start the project by executing the main Python file `time_table.py`.
2. Follow the on-screen prompts to perform various actions such as editing teacher details or generating timetables.
3. Input valid data as required by the program, ensuring accuracy and completeness.
4. Upon completion, the project will generate timetables in text and PDF formats for further use.

## Working of the Project
The School Timetable Generator operates with the following logic:
1. Read teacher data and define class details.
2. Display home screen and prompt user action.
3. Perform user-selected operations (e.g., edit teacher details, generate timetables).
4. Iterate through classes, assign faculty, and generate timetables.
5. Save output files and exit.

## Collaboration and Development
Collaboration on the School Timetable Generator project was facilitated by Visual Studio Code, a code editor, and the Live Share extension for real-time collaboration. This enabled efficient coding sessions, communication, and cross-checking of work, leading to the successful completion of the project.
